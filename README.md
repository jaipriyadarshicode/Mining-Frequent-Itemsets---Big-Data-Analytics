# Mining Frequent Itemsets - Big Data Analytics

Big data course project to find frequent itemsets by implementing two efficient algorithms: A-Priori and PCY. The goal was to find frequent pairs of elements and perform the scalability study for finding frequent pairs of elements by dividing the dataset into different chunks and measuring the time performance.
